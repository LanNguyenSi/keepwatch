# keepwatch

A small, self-hosted guardian for Linux servers.

Status: pre-MVP, under active development. Not ready for use.

keepwatch checks the security posture of a host (for example: is fail2ban
running, is SSH password login disabled, which ports are listening), reports
only what changed since the last run, and sends the result to a notification
channel. Later stages add log-based detection, optional triage with a local
LLM, and policy-gated, human-approved actions with a tamper-evident audit log.

## Build

Requires Go 1.27 or newer.

```sh
make build    # bin/keepwatch (host) and bin/keepwatch-linux-amd64, static
```

## Test

```sh
make test     # go test -race ./...
make lint     # gofmt, go vet, staticcheck
```

## Configuration

The main file is `/etc/keepwatch/keepwatch.yaml` (override with
`--config`). Every `*.yaml` in a `conf.d` directory next to it is loaded
in lexicographic order and merged in: mappings merge per key (later
files win), sequences such as `exceptions` and `listeners.allow` append,
and scalars are replaced by the later file. A missing `conf.d` is fine;
a missing main file is an error. Unknown keys, wrong types and out-of-range
values are rejected, each error naming `file:line`.

More rules, all reported with `file:line`:

- The root of every file must be a mapping (an empty or null document
  is treated as empty; a file never replaces another file's root).
- A key repeated within the same mapping of the same file is an error
  at any depth; the same key set again by a later file is an override.
  Validation runs on the merged result, so a value that a later file
  replaces is not checked on its own (known limit).
- `conf.d` must not be a symlink, dangling or not.
- `notify.ntfy.token_file` must be a clean absolute path (no `.`, `..`
  or repeated `/`).
- Scalars are matched by YAML type: `enabled` is true/false, `port` is
  an integer, strings are strings (quoted `"22"` is not a port),
  `expires` is a `YYYY-MM-DD` date. A null (`~`) value counts as absent
  for optional fields and is an error for required ones; a section key
  with a null value (an empty `exceptions:` or `checks:`, for example)
  counts as an absent section, and so do the optional nested mappings
  `checks.<id>.params`, `authorized_keys.expected` and `notify.ntfy`.
- A null value in a `conf.d` file contributes nothing where an earlier
  file already has the key: a drop-in with a bare `notify:` (or a block
  that is entirely commented out) leaves the main file's `notify`
  section intact. A null in an earlier file does not block a later one.
- Entries of `conf.d` whose name starts with a dot (`.hidden.yaml`, an
  editor lock symlink such as `.#a.yaml`) are ignored, like a shell glob
  ignores them.
- `*.yml` in `conf.d` is an error, and so is `a.YAML`, `b.Yml` or any
  other case of the extension: use lower-case `.yaml`. A
  subdirectory inside `conf.d` is an error too.
- Because keepwatch runs as root, the final component of every loaded
  path is never followed (a symlink is refused), and each file's type,
  size (max 1 MiB), permissions (no group or other write bits, mode
  0644 or stricter) and ownership (root or the running user) are
  checked on the open file descriptor itself. The directories holding
  the main file, `conf.d` and the token file must be real directories
  owned by root or the running user and not writable by group or
  other; deeper ancestor directories are not checked (known limit).
- `notify.ntfy.url` is required when `notify.ntfy` is set (https, or
  http only for loopback; a URL port must be 1-65535).
- `notify.ntfy.token_file` must be a regular file, at most 4096 bytes,
  with exactly one hard link, mode 0600 or stricter, owned by the
  running user and not empty; it is validated without reading and
  fully re-checked every time the token is read.
- `keepwatch init` writes the example file atomically (temp file +
  rename, mode 0640) into a directory that must not be a symlink or
  writable by group or other and must be owned by root or the running
  user; it refuses to follow symlinks, and `--force` only replaces a
  regular file.

```sh
keepwatch init --config /etc/keepwatch/keepwatch.yaml   # write a commented example
keepwatch config check --config /etc/keepwatch/keepwatch.yaml
```

## Checks

A check is an entry of the catalog (embedded in the binary, one YAML file)
that names a kind and its parameters. Every kind is read-only: it runs fixed
programs without a shell, or reads a file, and never touches the network.
A program that is not installed makes the check `skipped`; a timeout,
truncated output, an unexpected exit status or output that does not parse
makes it `error`, never `pass`.

| Kind | Reads | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `service_active` | `systemctl is-active -- <service>` | `service` (unit name) |
| `package_installed` | `dpkg-query -W` for one package | `package` (Debian package name) |
| `sshd_effective` | `sshd -T`, the effective configuration with drop-ins merged in | `option`, `allow` (list), `aliases` (list, optional) |
| `fail2ban_jail` | `fail2ban-client -- status <jail>` | `jail` |
| `listeners` | `ss -Hltn` and `ss -Hlun`, compared with `listeners.allow`; `ss -Hltnp` and `ss -Hlunp` only to name the processes | `allow_loopback` (default true), `protos` (list, default tcp and udp) |
| `reboot_required` | `/var/run/reboot-required` and `.pkgs`, and `needrestart -b -k -r l` when installed | none |

Names that reach a command line (unit, package and jail names) are checked
against a strict pattern, and a leading `-` is always rejected.

`listeners` takes the socket set from `ss` without `-p` alone; the process
names in the evidence come from a separate best-effort `ss -p` run that only
fills the detail text (a failing run leaves the processes "unknown" and never
changes the status). A listener bound to an interface is reported with the
interface after the address, for example `udp/[fe80::1]%eth0:546` or
`tcp/*%lo:7002`. `listeners.allow` cannot name an interface, so such a
listener is allowed by an entry for its address without the interface, or by
`bind: "*"`; `allow_loopback` only covers loopback addresses, not a wildcard
bound to `lo`. Files are read without following a symbolic link in the last
path component and only if they are regular files.

Under `checks.<id>` in the configuration, `enabled: false` skips a check,
`severity` replaces the catalog severity, and `params` are merged over the
catalog's parameters key by key: a key set in the configuration replaces
the catalog value as a whole. For the list parameters that means the
configured list replaces the catalog default (`allow` and `aliases` of
`sshd_effective`, `protos` of `listeners`); it never extends it. As for any
list in the configuration, lists set in `conf.d` drop-ins are appended to the
main file's list before the checks see them, so a drop-in can widen an
`allow`. The listener allowlist is the top-level `listeners.allow` section,
not a check parameter. Unknown parameter keys, wrong types and bad values
are errors, and so is a `checks.<id>` or `exceptions[].check` that names an id
the catalog does not have (an exception may also name `exception_expired`).

An active exception without `match` covers the whole check. With `match` it
covers the evidence items whose subject equals `match` exactly (for example
`tcp/0.0.0.0:8080`, `passwordauthentication`, `fail2ban.service`). A check
whose failing items are all covered becomes `excepted`; otherwise it stays
`fail` and the covered items are marked. Exceptions never change an `error`.
An `error` of a check that reads two sources (`reboot_required`, and
`listeners` with tcp and udp) keeps the failing items that the readable source
confirmed and says in its summary that the picture is partial.
Each expired exception is reported as its own `exception_expired` result
(severity low).

## Status

Pre-MVP. The command line skeleton, the program execution layer, the
strict configuration loader and the check engine with six check kinds exist;
`config check` and `init` are implemented, while the commands (`check`,
`report`, `doctor`, `install`, `uninstall`) are stubs that exit with status 3.
