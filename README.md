# keepwatch

A small, self-hosted guardian for Linux servers.

Status: pre-MVP, under active development. Not ready for use.

keepwatch checks the security posture of a host (for example: is fail2ban
running, is SSH password login disabled, which ports are listening), reports
only what changed since the last run, and sends the result to a notification
channel. Later stages add log-based detection, optional triage with a local
LLM, and policy-gated, human-approved actions with a tamper-evident audit log.

## Build

Requires Go 1.27 or newer.

```sh
make build    # bin/keepwatch (host) and bin/keepwatch-linux-amd64, static
```

## Test

```sh
make test     # go test -race ./...
make lint     # gofmt, go vet, staticcheck
```

## Configuration

The main file is `/etc/keepwatch/keepwatch.yaml` (override with
`--config`). Every `*.yaml` in a `conf.d` directory next to it is loaded
in lexicographic order and merged in: mappings merge per key (later
files win), sequences such as `exceptions` and `listeners.allow` append,
and scalars are replaced by the later file. A missing `conf.d` is fine;
a missing main file is an error. Unknown keys, wrong types and out-of-range
values are rejected, each error naming `file:line`.

```sh
keepwatch init --config /etc/keepwatch/keepwatch.yaml   # write a commented example
keepwatch config check --config /etc/keepwatch/keepwatch.yaml
```

## Status

Pre-MVP. The command line skeleton, the program execution layer and the
strict configuration loader exist; `config check` and `init` are
implemented, while the commands (`check`, `report`, `doctor`, `install`,
`uninstall`) are stubs that exit with status 3.
